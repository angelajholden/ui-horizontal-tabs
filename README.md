# Horizontal Tabs

## Simple UI Component made with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

I built this horizontal tab component to practice my JavaScript and to add and remove classes with `addEventListener('click')` . This component listens to the button click and compares the button `data-id=" "` with the content `data-id=" "`, then adds or removes an `.active` class.

I fully enjoyed building this. Use it and enjoy it.

Cheers!
